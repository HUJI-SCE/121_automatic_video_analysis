## üìö Project Description
Our solution aims to automate the classification of defects in water pipelines using IPIPE‚Äôs video data. We employ a Vision Transformer (ViT) Neural Network to analyze the data and extract vectors of image features. These feature vectors are then classified using a KNN classifier. This approach leverages the power of deep learning and machine learning techniques to accurately identify and classify anomalies in pipeline videos, contributing to improved maintenance and operational efficiency.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Method
Our automated analysis model is designed to process video inputs by initially segmenting them into individual frames. Each frame undergoes preprocessing steps, which include binary labeling, augmenting the frames, as well as adding noise reduction techniques to enhance image clarity.
These preprocessed frames are then analyzed using a Vision Transformer (ViT) neural network, which extracts high-level features from each image. These feature vectors capture important patterns and characteristics present in the frames.
The extracted feature vectors are then inputted into a k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for supervised feature vector detection. This detector categorizes each frame based on the learned patterns, facilitating the identification of potential issues or defects within the video footage.
